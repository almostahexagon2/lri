History
===

On 2025-07-03 (The early summer of '25), the google doc for LRI was created. The actual language probably predates this by a bit.  

The name
---
Lanrepunido means "successor of the language of good people", referring to lanrepn, an earlier conlang with the same goal. "lan" comes from the lanrepn true formless root lan-, meaning language or speech. "repun" comes from repn, the positive noun form of re-- , meaning a "good community". The etymology of re is complex, tied to the histoy of lanrepn. Now, repun (along with tolnaj) are archaic words, because antux- is more in line with the lri philosophy than repunes-. However, they are kept mostly to keep the name of the language the same and give lri some fun history. 

When LRI was created, repn was added, later, with much debate, it was changed to repun. more details about debate, phonotactics, ect
