History
===

On 2025-07-03 (The early summer of '25), the google doc for LRI was created. The actual language probably predates this by a bit.  

The name
---
Lanrepunido means "successor of the language of good people", referring to lanrepn, an earlier conlang with the same goal. "lan" comes from the lanrepn true formless root lan-, meaning language or speech. "repun" comes from repn, the positive noun form of re-- , meaning a "good community". The etymology of re is complex, tied to the histoy of lanrepn. Now, repun (along with tolnaj) are archaic words, because antux- is more in line with the lri philosophy than repunes-. However, they are kept mostly to keep the name of the language the same and give lri some fun history. 

When LRI was created, repn was added, later, with much debate, it was changed to repun. more details about debate, phonotactics, ect

Word Order
---
When lri was created, it was head initial, both in compound words and in phrases. Later(inculde date), prefixes and suffixes were added that where head final. This caused kunsi-sa to make the whole language head final. Kunsi-sa didn't actually like this (why, compuonds?), so he made it head initial again, except for the prefixes (mostly used on verbs at the time) and suffixes. According to him, it feels more natural, and more comprehensible. 


j, The Seperator
---
When the prefixes were created, they would not have "j" at the end. If a prefix was added to a word with a that started with a vowel, then it would have a j inserted to break the hiatus, this j is pronounced. Additionaly, "mal" would not have the "l" before a consonant. Kunsi-sa found it harder to make out and understand prefixes with this system, so he just added a "j" to all of the prefixes, and "ma(l)" was always written as "mal". The "j" is always pronounced in this system. This is still how it is to this day. However, when the vimrepuno(link) and vimrepuno nova(also link) were created, the "j" is not written there. In [hangul mallona](orthography/hangul-mallona.md), the "j" letter is written only when ending a syllable (ie "aj"), as opposed to being part of a vowel (ie "ja"). Since words like "kupajo" should be thought as "kupaj" + "o", it is written as "ku.paj.o" rather than "ku.pa.jo". There are also words such as "kupaj", and "aisoj", which have a "j". Names like "ruskij" and "polskij" have this j too. However, there are words such as "matj-" and "linj-" and "putj-", which are always written, and pronounced with a "j". Words that are "@j", have the first type of j, while words that are "Cj" have the latter. Now, J is used in words like "ojo", "ija" and "ujo" to seperate vowels.

When combining a word that ends in "Cj" (like "linj") and some other root (like "<ruby><rb>linj</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>line</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>kiroso</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>big</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>", the "j" can be difficult to fully pronounce. Optionally, you are allowed to palatalise the consonant before and not say the "j", making "linjkiroso" sound closer to "lin'kiroso" (линькиросо).
