## Basic overview
hangul mallona is a very <ruby><rb>한글</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>hangeul</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>-styled and inspired writing system (if not already extremely obvious by the name and its appearance). By arranging consonants and vowels together in "blocks", you can build syllables and spell out words.

Hint: ø denotes a silent letter (no sound). ø/j ju silent ve beginning of a syllable (before vowel), i it makes the `j` sound at the end (after vowel)

Be careful: although aj sounds like it has 1 consonant, it is thought of as øaj, which has 2 consonants.
