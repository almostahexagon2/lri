## Basic overview
hangul mallona is a very Hangeul-styled and inspired writing system (if not already extremely obvious by the name and its appearance). By arranging consonants and vowels together in "blocks", you can build syllables and spell out words.

Hint: ø denotes a silent letter (no sound). ø/j is silent at the beginning of a syllable (before vowel), and makes the /j/ sound at the end (after vowel)*
