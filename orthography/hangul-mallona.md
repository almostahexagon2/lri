**hangul mallona** ju segmental syllabary created by evila-se on 2025-10-02

## Basic overview
hangul mallona is a very <ruby><rb>한글</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>hangeul</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>-styled and inspired writing system (if not already extremely obvious by the name and its appearance). By arranging consonants and vowels together in "blocks", you can build syllables and spell out words.

Hint: ø denotes a silent letter (no sound). ø/j ju silent ve beginning of a syllable (before vowel), i it makes the `j` sound at the end (after vowel)

Be careful: although aj sounds like it has 1 consonant, it is thought of as øaj, which has 2 consonants.

These 3 images describe most (if not all) of hangul mallona.

## puko (dot)
A centre dot acts like `-` au `'` in vimaisojo. It is used (optionally) to separate names i titles(?), i like `'` in songs (to fit a specific rhythm).

# czasznami
A <ruby><rb>**czasz**</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>container</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>**namo**</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>word</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> is, as the name implies, a box drawn around words to give special meaning. They are used pretty similarly to how evila-se uses \[brackets], which is outlined below. They can take up multiple lines; just cut off the left/right sides \[if/when] needed.

Draw a czasznamo around nami that:
- are names (obviously not limitied to people). If you put \[-ga/-sa/-se/-szi/-szite], put it outside the czasznamo.
- are "selections" (which is best explained as this: "which is greater? 5 \[plus/minus] 2?", where the \[brackets] are replaced with czasznami).
- are part of a quote. Draw a czasznamo around the whole quote.
- have to with variables, explained below.

## variables
A "variable" is a piece of text that represents a whole compound or a few words, represented in vimaisojo with a capitalised word and some kind of definition. For example:
```
ix tilu Domo. Domo ju domkisejuxo.
ix xajhavu pomi nova 3jo ve Domo.
```
Here, `Domo` referrs to the defined `domkisejuxo`, which could mean mall (group of building money), and is referenced in the line below. In hangul mallona, the `Domo` is represented by drawing a czasznamo around "domo". This does mean a czasznamo'ed "domo" could be part of a quote or a name, but that is left up to context (unless I decide to change that).
