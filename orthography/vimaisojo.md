Letters not in parens are IPA, letters in () are orthography. `-z` can be thought of as moving the sound one column back. 
Originaly, `qz` was written `dz`, but was changed for consistency. The 5 vowels are written as they are in the IPA.
Instead of digraphs, one can use a haček to mark `-z`. Only kunsi-sa consistently uses hačeks.

Order
----
Consonant order is based on this IPA chart. Go left to right, then top to bottom (mostly), digraphs are treated as their own letters. Vowels are listed first, in the order `a,o,i,u,e`. Evila-sa created this order on 2025-10-22. According to him, this order represents how the word endings are used. 

The full order is (as of 2025-12-21): `p,b, t,d, k,g, c,q, cz,qz, m,n, f,v, s,z, sz,rz, x,h, w,j, l,r`. Spaces are added for clarity
