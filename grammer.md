### Word order
LRI is SVO. LRI is mostly head inital; however, affixes and verb prefixes are mostly head final. Even though, the [LRI principle](later.md) says that all words should be treated the same, it is helpful to think of the suffixes and prefixes as a separate class just because they are head final. Technichly, word endings (a..o) could be though of as being in the suffix class because they are also head final.

`lan+repun+id+o`
Here, `lan+repun` is head inital, but `+ido` is head final. For more information on why this is, see [the histoy page](/history.md).

| Prefix | Meaning | Example | Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| rej- | To do again | Rej,mis,paj,anaku \= to repeatedly fail to establish anarchism | esperanto |
| paj- | To make (something become) | paj,muku \= make food  | Toki pona “pali” |
| xaj- | To become  | xaj,sonu \= become knowing  | A priori |
| mis- | mis- (to do in the wrong way) | mis,lanu \= misspoke | Esperanto |
| kep- | To use/consume | kep,muku \= eat food | a priori |
| dis- | To emit or scatter | dis,muku \= give food | esperanto  |
| kjen- | Able to | kjen,paj,muku \= able to cook | Toki pona |
| mal- | The exact opposite of | mal,anakanto \= unanarchist | esperanto |

These prefixes are appended to the front of the words they apply to, they are mostly for verbs, however, there are nouns like `paj+lan+o`, meaning conlang.

| Suffix | Meaning | Example | Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \-ant- | One who | anak**ant**o \= anarchist | esperanto |
| \-es- | Unit/part of | repn**es**o \= person | \<se\> from LR |
| \-ux- | group/connection of | namuxo \= dictionary (word group) | a priori |
| \-id- | child/successor of | lanrepunido | esperanto |
| \-il- | Tool of | konp**il**o \= computer | esperanto |
| \-at- | place/container/country of | Anak**at**o \= place of anarchism | A priori  |
| \-ecz- | affectionate/diminutive | At**ecz**o \= micronation | A priori |
| \-isum- | ism | anark**isum**o \= anarchism | english |

These suffixes go on the end of what they modify, for example `pajlan+ant+ux+o` meaning, a group of conlangers.
