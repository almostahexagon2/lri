| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| son (about) | \- | preposition |

| son,e (smartly) | \-e | adverb |
| son,o (knowledge) | \-o | noun |

### Word order
LRI is SVO. It is mostly head inital; however, affixes and verb prefixes are mostly head final. Even though, the [LRI principle](later.md) says that all words should be treated the same, it is helpful to think of the suffixes and prefixes as a separate class just because they are head final. Technically, word endings (a, o, i, u, e) could be though of as being in the suffix class because they are also head final.

`lan+repun+id+o`
Here, `lan+repun` is head inital, but `+ido` is head final. For more information on why this is, see [the history page](/history.md).

| Prefix | Meaning | Example | Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| rej- | To do again | Rej,mis,paj,anaku \= to repeatedly fail to establish anarchism | esperanto |
| paj- | To make (something become) | paj,muku \= make food  | Toki pona “pali” |
| xaj- | To become  | xaj,sonu \= become knowing  | A priori |
| mis- | mis- (to do in the wrong way) | mis,lanu \= misspoke | Esperanto |
| kep- | To use/consume | kep,muku \= eat food | a priori |
| dis- | To emit or scatter | dis,muku \= give food | esperanto  |
| kjen- | Able to | kjen,paj,muku \= able to cook | Toki pona |
| mal- | The exact opposite of | mal,anakanto \= unanarchist | esperanto |

These prefixes are appended to the front of the words they apply to, they are mostly for verbs, however, there are nouns like `paj+lan+o`, meaning conlang.

| Suffix | Meaning | Example | Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \-ant- | One who | anak**ant**o \= anarchist | esperanto |
| \-es- | Unit/part of | repn**es**o \= person | \<se\> from LR |
| \-ux- | group/connection of | namuxo \= dictionary (word group) | a priori |
| \-id- | child/successor of | lanrepunido | esperanto |
| \-il- | Tool of | konp**il**o \= computer | esperanto |
| \-at- | place/container/country of | Anak**at**o \= place of anarchism | A priori  |
| \-ecz- | affectionate/diminutive | At**ecz**o \= micronation | A priori |
| \-isum- | ism | anark**isum**o \= anarchism | english |

These suffixes go on the end of what they modify, for example `pajlan+ant+ux+o` meaning, a group of conlangers.

### Questions
Yes or no questions are formed by using [ka](https://almostahexagon2.github.io/lri/#!././vocabulary.md#ka). 
`Aq wilu kepmuku.`
`You want to eat.`

`Aq wilu kepmuku ka?`
`Do you want to eat?`

### Commands
Add `xo` after your subject to make a statement into a command. If your subject is already known, the subject can be removed.
`Matji, xo muku.`
`Parents, eat.`

Comparisions
---
To say `X is more Y than Z`, use `X ju Y ol Z` or `X havu ij Y ol Z`
`My apple is redder than your apple.`
`Pomo ixa bolszeku ol pomo aqa`
`My apple reds than yours`

`Pomo ixa havu ij bolszeko ol pomo aqa.`
`My apple has more red than yours.`

To say some thing is less than or the same as something else, replace `ij` in the last example with `malij` or `sam`.
`My apple is as red as yours.`
`Pomo ixa havu sam bolszeko ol pomo aqa.`

To say something is the most, or biggest, use `ol alo`.
`Ixaq havu ij sud ol alo`
`We have more strength then all`

Prepositions
----
LRI prepositional phrases go after the noun the relate to.

| Prepostion | Meaning | Example | Translation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ve | in, at, on | ix ve anakato | Im **in** a place of anarchy |
| da | from | Ix da anakato | Im **from** a place of anarchy |
| kep | using | ix kiriku kep kirikilo | I fight **using** a tool |
| kun | with | ix **kun** ixa repuneso | Im **with** a friend |
| kirik | against | ix **kirik** aq |  |
| sam | similar | ix-aq sam eti | we are **similar** (to) them |
| ris | because |  |  |
| za | for |  | Russian за |
| til | to |  |  |
| mut | more (than) |  |  |
| son | about |  |  |

The prepositions "ve" and "til" are often shortend to "v" and "t" when typed. They are often pronounced as part of the next word, so `ve putjo` is shortend to `v putjo` and pronounced /f_putjo/.  The preposition will devoice if preceded by a voiceless consonat and will voice before a voiced consonant.

Ve can also be used to form the present progressive tense when put before a verb.

Subordinate Clauses
---
According to the original doc, LRI subordinate clauses were unmaked. However, when sentences become more complex, then they are marked, mostly in questions. 

| Style | Example | Extra |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| unmarked | ix sonu repuno haja zivu | |
| marked | ix sonu kjo: repuno haja zivu | A newline usally procedes the semicolon |

 ### Relative Clauses
 LRI does not have relative clauses because they can be easily expressed in 2 sentences or using `tje`. For the last example, It is acceptable to use a `,` insted of `:`.  Yes, the last two examples are basicly the same thing. Kunsi-sa would consider using `tje` to be the most "LRI like" and "proper".
 
| Language | Meaning |
| ----  | ----- |
| English | I see the kid who has the red ball. |
| Using `tje` | Ido kjo havu balo bolszeka tje, Ix vidu et. |
| 2 Sentences | Ix vidu ido kjo. Et havu balo bolszeka. |
| Using `:` | Ix vidu ido kjo: et havu balo bolszeka. |
