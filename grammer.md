### Endings
| example | vowel | type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| son (about) | \- | preposition |
| son,a (smart) | \-a | adjective |
| son,e (smartly) | \-e | adverb |
| son,o (knowledge) | \-o | noun |
| son,i (knowledges) | \-i | plural noun |
|  son,u (to know)  | \-u | verb |

### Word order
LRI is SVO. It is mostly head inital; however, affixes and verb prefixes are mostly head final. Even though, the [LRI principle](later.md) says that all words should be treated the same, it is helpful to think of the suffixes and prefixes as a separate class just because they are head final. Technically, word endings (a, o, i, u, e) could be though of as being in the suffix class because they are also head final.

`lan+repun+id+o`
Here, `lan+repun` is head inital, but `+ido` is head final. For more information on why this is, see [the history page](/history.md).

| Prefix | Meaning | Example | Meaning | Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| rej- | To do again | rej,vidu | to see again | esperanto |
| paj- | To make | paj,muku | make food (cook)  | Toki pona “pali” |
| xaj- | To become  | xaj,sonu | become knowing  | A priori |
| mis- | To do in the wrong way | mis,lanu | misspeak | Esperanto |
| kep- | To use/consume | kep,muku | eat food | a priori |
| dis- | To emit or scatter | dis,muku | give food | esperanto  |
| kjen- | Able to | kjen,paj,muku | able make food | Toki pona |
| mal- | The exact opposite of | mal,kirosa | small | esperanto |

These prefixes are appended to the front of the words they apply to, they are mostly for verbs, however, there are nouns like `paj+lan+o`, meaning conlang.
#### paj and xaj
The suffixes xaj and paj are frequenly misused, likely becaues they have been poorly defined. Have another table:

| Usage            | Translation | Example   | Meaning |
| :----------------| :---------- | :---- | :----- |
| Intransative xaj | subject becomes | ix **xaj**kunu | I unite |
| Transative xaj   | subject makes object become | ix **xaj**kunu pomi. | I unite the fruits. |
| Intransative paj | subject creates | ix **paj**pjuku | I make a book |




| Suffix | Meaning | Example | Origin |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \-ic- | One who | kirik**ic**o \= fighter | esperanto |
| \-es- | Smallest unit/atom | sang**es**o \= phoneme | \<se\> from LR |
| \-ux- | group/connection of | namuxo \= dictionary (word group) | a priori |
| \-id- | child/successor of | lanrepunido | esperanto |
| \-il- | Tool of | konp**il**o \= computer | esperanto |
| \-at- | place/container/country of | Amerik**at**o \= America | A priori  |
| \-ecz- | affectionate/diminutive | At**ecz**o \= micronation | A priori |
| \-isum- | ism | son**isum**o \= science (knowledgeism) | english |

These suffixes go on the end of what they modify, for example `pajlan+ant+ux+o` meaning, a group of conlangers.

Also: Don't try to say `pajlanantuxo` as `paj.lan.ant.ux.o`, that will only make it hard for you and the listener. Just say `paj.lan.antu.xo`

### Questions
Yes or no questions are formed by using [ka](https://almostahexagon2.github.io/lri/#!././vocabulary.md#ka). 
`Aq wilu kepmuku.`
`You want to eat.`

`Aq wilu kepmuku ka?`
`Do you want to eat?`

### Commands
Add `xo` after your subject to make a statement into a command. If your subject is already known, the subject can be removed.
`Matji, xo muku.`
`Parents, eat.`

Comparisions
---
To say `X is more Y than Z`, use `X ju Y ol Z` or `X havu ij Y ol Z`
`My apple is redder than your apple.`
`Pomo ixa bolszeku ol pomo aqa`
`My apple reds than yours`

`Pomo ixa havu ij bolszeko ol pomo aqa.`
`My apple has more red than yours.`

To say some thing is less than or the same as something else, replace `ij` in the last example with `malij` or `sam`.
`My apple is as red as yours.`
`Pomo ixa havu sam bolszeko ol pomo aqa.`

To say something is the most, or biggest, use `ol alo`.
`Ixaq havu ij sud ol alo`
`We have more strength then all`

Often, `havu ij` is dropped.
`Nico sinifu ol alo`
`The start is more important`

Prepositions
----
LRI prepositional phrases go after the noun the relate to. Prepositions function more like conjunctions.

| Prepostion | Meaning | Example | Translation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ve | in, at, on | ix **ve** domo | Im **in** a house  |
| da | from | Ix tilu da domo | I came **from** house |
| kep | using | ix kiriku kep kirikilo | I fight **using** a tool |
| kun | with | ix **kun** ixa sajo | Im **with** a friend |
| kirik | against | ix **kirik** aq | Im against you |
| sam | similar | ixaq sam eti | we are **similar** (to) them |
| ris | because | ix kepmuku **ris** aq pajmuku | I eat **because** you eat |
| za | for | ix paju kjo **za** aq | I made that **for** you |
| til | to | ix tilu **til** domo | Im going **to** house |
| son | about | aq lanu son ex? | what are you talking about? |
| xe  | in    | ix paju kjo xe djeno | I will do in a day. |

The prepositions "ve" and "til" are often shortend to "v" and "t" when typed. They are often pronounced as part of the next word, so `ve putjo` is shortend to `v putjo` and pronounced /f_putjo/.  The preposition will devoice if preceded by a voiceless consonant and will voice before a voiced consonant.

The prepositions `da`, `ve`, and `til` can be used to form tenses when put before a verb. `ix ve muku` means "I am eating", `ix til muku` means "I will eat" and `ix da muku` means "I ate".

### xe vs ve
`xe` is used for non absolute time. `ix paju kjo xe djeno uno.` means "I will do this tomorrow( in one day)" while `ix paju kjo ve djeno uno` means "I will do it over the course of one day." For actions in the past, you can make the quanitity of time negative.

Subordinate Clauses
---
According to the original doc, LRI subordinate clauses were unmaked. However, when sentences become more complex, then they are marked, mostly in questions. 

| Style | Example | Extra |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| unmarked | ix sonu repuno haja zivu | |
| marked | ix sonu kjo: repuno haja zivu | A newline usally procedes the colon |

 ### Relative Clauses
 LRI does not have relative clauses because they can be easily expressed in 2 sentences or using `tje`. For examples 3 and 4, It is acceptable to use a `,` insted of `:`.  Yes, they're basically the same. Kunsi-sa would consider using `tje` to be the most "LRI like" and "proper". Brackets are only sometimes over discord for complex sentences. Evila-sa came up with brackets, but kunsi-sa sometimes uses them.
 
| Language | Meaning |
| ----  | ----- |
| 1. English | I see the kid who has the red ball. |
| 2. Using `tje` | Ido kjo havu balo bolszeka tje, Ix vidu et. |
| 3. 2 Sentences | Ix vidu ido kjo. Et havu balo bolszeka. |
| 4. Using `:` | Ix vidu ido kjo: et havu balo bolszeka. | 
| 5. Brackets | Ix vidu [ido havu balo]. |

## Proposed Grammer
### Relative Clauses: `czto`
`czto` (from russian что) was first used by Evila-sa on (date) on discord. Kunsi-sa was originally against it, and still tries to avoid it, but accepts it as a useful word and has use it in the pukuxrepuno. It is used to start a relative clause. For example, `Ix vidu ico czto ac ico.` Means "I see the person that you see."


### Short Forms
Technically official now, but here's the full list. probably will be moved up

| Word | Short Form |
|----- | -------- |
| ve | v |
| til | t |
| da | d |
| kep/kun | k,z[^1] |
| mal | m |

This was likely Evila-sa's idea, and is mostly fully adopted. A `'` can be used to indicate that a word is in its short form. 

[^1]: Evila-sa uses z, and has expanded its meaning to English "with". Kunsi-sa thinks that this is stupid, and uses k. 

### Regrouping: `aj`
`aj` (from a and j) is used to limit the scope of a modifier. For example `fjako kejojo djennico` means "(flag of the sky) of the morning", but `fjako aj kejojo djennico` means "flag of (the sky of the morning)". 

`aj` has been used to name the dictionary sheet: "namuxo kirosa aj lanrepunido", however, it is not needed here, and nobody has ever found a use for it. 

### Subject Dropping
With enough context, or if who the statement applies to is unimportant, the subject (usually ix) can be completely removed. For example, if someone sends a screenshot of a download in progress, they can say `finu` when it's done.
