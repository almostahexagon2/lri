# Phonology
Phonology is the set of sounds in a language.

## Consonants

| Afr.      |        | ts,dz (c,q) | tഽ,dʒ (cz,qz) |      |       | |

When a compound word makes the same consonant appear, that consonant becomes geminate, "dissonico" is pronounced /dis:onitso/. If a compound forms vowel hiatus, then it is broken with a `j` inserted between them.

## Vowels
LRI as the vowels, /a/, /o/, /i/, /u/, /e/ and the dipthongs /ai/, /ei/, /oi/, and /au/.

## Phonotactics
cJvc is strongly advised.
