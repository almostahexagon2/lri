# All of the LRI vocab, in one place.

LRI is highly [aggultinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language), meaning that words are combined together to produce bigger words. Even simple words like "lanu" should be thought as "lan+u". For more information on this see [the grammer section](grammer.md).

## Rules for new roots
For a root to be added, it must meet several requirenments:

1. Be hard, impractical or impossible to express with a compound or preexisting roots. For example, "shirt" can be "fjak-" or "fjakrzivis-".
2. Be a someting that is commonly said by is speakers or useful to write down. While "hypothermia" is hard to express, but not commonly said or needed to be written.
3. Do not make roots that should be 2 or more roots. If hypothermia was to be commonly said, a root for sickness should be created and be combined with "malheis-"
4. When a root is added, it should not be hard to say or write. Examples of bad roots are "zunkunft" and "dostoprimiczatelnost-". The former was changed, while the second is a joke word, like toki pona's "kijetasantakalu".

## Structure
Each word will have its own section, each section will have what the word will mean as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, or used in a compound or interjection. Example sencences and common phrases will also be included. "@" means any vowel normaly one of the simple endings. "-lkdfsa" indicates "lkdfsa" at the end of a word or compound. 

## Simple Endings
### "a"
When "a" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it an adjective. To say the word "adjective" use "namo a". The word for a property is "ajo".

### "o"
When "o" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it an noun. To say the word "noun" use "namo o". The word for thing is "ojo". "-ojo" means "thing of". For example, "stelojo" is a physical star, like our sun, while "stelo" (is a common esperanto name), only represents the shape of a star.

### "i"
When "i" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it plural. To say the word "plural noun" use "namo i". "ij@", means "many", "very", and "a lot" depening on what @ is. Yes, "mut" has been deprecated.

### "u"
When "u" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it a verb. To say the word "verb" use "namo u". "ujo", means "process, or action". "ju" is the copula. "-ujo" can be used as a gerund and "-uja" for a participle; however, it should be noted that you often do not need these and can just use "-@" instead. It should only used when using the "o" or "a" forms of a word would make not make sense. For example, there is not a meaningful difference between "Ix amu mukujo", "Ix amu muku" and "Ix amu muko" (I like the process of eating, I like to eat, I like to eat and I like food.). These are these are technicly different, but all carry the same meaning.

### "e"
When "e" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it an adverb. To say the word "adverb" use "namo e". The word for a manner or way is "ejo".

## Grammical words
### ex
"ex" is the equivlant of "(w)h*" in english. "ex" is most often used without an ending because it can be inferred from context, however endings can still be used. "Aq djelu exo?" means "You are doing what?". "Aq exu?" means the same thing. "Aq ju exa?" means "You are whaty?". Think about it like "What adjectives can describe you?". 

### i
"i" means and.
`ix havu pjuko i muko.` 
`I have book and food.`
"i" can be used to combine subjects, verbs, objects or sentences.

Note: Sometimes it can be spelled "y", usually found in kirisu-sa's writings. "y" and "i" mean the same thing.

### xau
"xau" means xor.
`Aq muku xau vidu.`
`You are eating or seeing but you are not doing both.`

### au
"au" means or.
`Aq muku au vidu.`
`You are eating or seeing but you can be doing both.`

### ka
"ka" makes a statement into a question.
`Aq havu pjuko ka?`
`Do you have a book?`

### tje
"tje" introduces context. The format is `"context" tje "statment"`.
`Aq pajmuku tje, ix kepmuku.`
`If you cook, I will eat.` 
See the [main page](later.md).

### nj
"nj-" comes from the russian word "не". "nje" can negate a sentence. "nja" means none of and "njo" means nothing. "nj" on its own means no.
`Ix nje havu pjuko.`
`I do not have a book.`
`Ix havu pjuko nja.`
`I have no books`
`Ix havu njo.`
`I have nothing.`
 
### xo
"xo" turns a statement into a command. "xo" is put between the subject and the verb.
`Aq xo havu pjuko.`
`You, have a book.`
It can be simplified to `Xo havu pjuko.` if your subject is already known.
