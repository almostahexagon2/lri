# All of the LRI vocab, in one place.

LRI is higly [aggultinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language), meaning that words are combined together to produce bigger words. Even simple words like "lanu" should be thought as "lan+u". For more information on this see [the grammer section](grammer.md).

## Structure
Each word will have its own section, each section will have what the word will mean as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, or used in a compound or interjection. Example sencences and common phrases will also be included. "@" means any vowel normaly one of the simple endings. "-lkdfsa" indicates "lkdfsa" at the end of a word or compound. 

## Simple Endings
### "a"
When "a" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it an adjective. To say the word "adjective" use "namo a". The word for a property is "ajo".
### "i"
When "i" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it plural. To say the word "plural noun" use "namo i". "ij@", means "many", "very", and "a lot" depening on what @ is. Yes, "mut" has been deprecated.
### "u"
When "u" is used at the end of a word or compound, it makes it a verb. To say the word "verb" use "namo u". "ujo", means "process, or action". "ju" is the copula. "-ujo" can be used as a gerund and "-uja" for a participle; however, it should be noted that you often do not need these and can just use "-@" instead. It should only used when using the "o" or "a" forms of a word would make not make sense. For example, there is not a meaningful difference between "Ix amu mukujo", "Ix amu muku" and "Ix amu muko" (I like the process of eating, I like to eat, I like to eat and I like food.). These are these are technicly different, but all carry the same meaning.
